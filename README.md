Development process
    This website is for the users who need to track their daily stretching specially who has specific pain on their body parts, such as wrist pain, back pain or neck.

    This website contains a logo with the title of the website 'DoStretching', and some quotes that
    automatically slide to next and the part that can see what the user add their daily stretching. 
    Also, there is a function that calls using + button on the top right corner which can add
    their daily stretching details to track them.

    Further more, there are two small buttons that can remove the contents that the user add and 
    the button that can close the pop up window (adding the contents).

    As I designed the web based on blue colors, I was trying to emphasize the feeling of relax and cool
    as calm beach. Which can connect to sports such as yoga or meditation.

    The parts that needs to be improve are:
        1. make more flexible for any other size of device
        2. The function that can change(edit) saved contens (not deleting and add again)
        3. More functions that will help user to track their status, such as graph of how long and what date did they do the stretching, or can connect with other friends for having fun etc.
